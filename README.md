# ACRE-Radio-Damage
##Adds a configurable chance of destroying your radios upon taking damage.

###Damage chance can be found in CBA Settings/Addon Options under ACRE Radio Damage.

This mod adds a probabilty to destroy your ACRE2 radios upon receiving damage to the Torso. I'm not smart enough to only use certain types or levels of damage in my calculations. As such, any damage will trigger the calculation (evening falling a small distance or getting shot by a low caliber pistol). Adjust the settings until your desired level of difficulty/fun is reached. I personally perfer 4% for handheld radios and 6% for manpacks.
